    <p> 
Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Uttirn Gyan, and I am a Blockchain Developer. Through my work, I aim to create meaningful and impactful experiences that resonate with people and inspire positive change.

From a young age, I have always been fascinated by the power of creativity and its ability to connect people from different backgrounds and cultures. As I grew older, I realized that the best way to express my own creativity and share it with others was through Programming.

In addition to my professional work, I also enjoy playing basketball in my free time. These activities help me to stay inspired and bring a fresh perspective to my work.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work. If you would like to collaborate on a project or have any questions, please feel free to reach out.</p>
